                    <p>As you enter the Show, groves of Citrus trees lead the way providing a lush dramatic promenade to the sunshine 
                        drenched landscape ahead. Drifts of purple and white spiked salvia, specimen succulents and, an intoxicating variety 
                        of scented geraniums, roses, rosemary and sage create a stunning mosaic that is at once picturesque and charming. 
                        Walk the esplanade of flowering arches.</p>
                    <p>Rivera Holiday beckons you to embrace your inner romantic and create a Mediterranean inspired garden of your own. 
                        Ornate pottery and patterned tiles, a well-placed pergola and abundant clusters of scented flowers, ornamental fountains 
                        and herb parterres provide irresistible appeal along with sustainable lower maintenance, water-wise options that are both 
                        responsive to and reflective of temperate conditions.</p>

                        <p>The PHS Philadelphia Flower Show is the nation's largest and longest-running horticultural event and features 
                            stunning displays by the world’s premier floral and landscape designers.</p>
                        
                        <img>
                        <p>Started in 1829 by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the Show introduces the newest plant varieties, garden and 
                            design concepts, and organic and sustainable practices.</p>
                            
                        <p>In addition to the major garden displays, the Flower Show hosts world-renowned competitions in horticulture and 
                            artistic floral arranging, gardening presentations and demonstrations, special events, a mammoth indoor Marketplace, 
                            and the Bloom Philly Festival in the weeks leading up to the Show.</p>

                            <p class="show-for-md">Show organizers wanted to invite a special guest for the 1976 show held during the year of the nation’s bicentennial 
                                and were delighted when Princess Grace of Monaco accepted their invitation. Princess Grace, a Philadelphia native, 
                                was a practitioner of the floral arts and studied the art of pressed flower compositions from Katie King, a long-time 
                                show competitor. Photo courtesy PHS McLean Library & Archives. Proceeds from the Flower Show benefit the year-round
