            <p>As you enter the Show, groves of Citrus trees lead the way providing a lush dramatic promenade to the sunshine 
                drenched landscape ahead. Drifts of purple and white spiked salvia, specimen succulents and, an intoxicating variety 
                of scented geraniums, roses, rosemary and sage create a stunning mosaic that is at once picturesque and charming. 
                Walk the esplanade of flowering arches.</p>
            <p>Rivera Holiday beckons you to embrace your inner romantic and create a Mediterranean inspired garden of your own. 
                Ornate pottery and patterned tiles, a well-placed pergola and abundant clusters of scented flowers, ornamental fountains 
                and herb parterres provide irresistible appeal along with sustainable lower maintenance, water-wise options that are both 
                responsive to and reflective of temperate conditions.</p>
