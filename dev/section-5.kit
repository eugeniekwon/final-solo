        <p class="show-for-md">Show organizers wanted to invite a special guest for the 1976 show held during the year of the nation’s bicentennial 
            and were delighted when Princess Grace of Monaco accepted their invitation. Princess Grace, a Philadelphia native, 
            was a practitioner of the floral arts and studied the art of pressed flower compositions from Katie King, a long-time 
            show competitor. Photo courtesy PHS McLean Library & Archives. Proceeds from the Flower Show benefit the year-round 
            programs of PHS that have become national models of urban greening.</p>
