                        <p>Show organizers wanted to invite a special guest for the 1976 show held during the year of the nation’s bicentennial 
                            and were delighted when Princess Grace of Monaco accepted their invitation. Princess Grace, a Philadelphia native, 
                            was a practitioner of the floral arts and studied the art of pressed flower compositions from Katie King, a long-time 
                            show competitor. Photo courtesy PHS McLean Library & Archives. Proceeds from the Flower Show benefit the year-round 
                            programs of PHS that have become national models of urban greening.</p>

                        <p>PHS is a diverse community of people and organizations who believe in the power of horticulture to make positive social 
                            and environmental change. This community invests their time, passion, money, and gardens in our cause. Together, 
                            we produce the Philadelphia Flower Show, offer a network of free-to-all public gardens and landscapes, educate and 
                            inspire home gardeners, and work with residents in 250+ neighborhoods to plant trees, tend community gardens and vacant 
                            lots, and help people transition from incarceration to stable employment.</p>
